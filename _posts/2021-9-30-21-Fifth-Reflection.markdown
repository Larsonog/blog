## birthday

This was an important week for me. It was my birthday week!!! I turned 22 which is fun. I had so many people sing happy birthday to me or wish me a happy birthday. Usually I don't tell people it's my birthday because I feel like that seems like I am asking for attention. Or maybe I just assume everyone knows it's my birthday. This has resulted in many birthdays with little acknowledgement from my peers. Definitely my fault. Anyways I posted on my instagram story that it was my birthday and then everyone found out. The only bad thing to come of my birthday was that I was thrown into the fountain and I had to go through all of my classes and extracurriculars. But it still was a good day. My roommate/ best friend is supprising me this weekend with some adventure/outing with a small group of our friends. I'm not sure what we're doing or where we are going. I've heard it's either 40 mins away or an hour and 20 mins away. I'll update this again later when I find out whats happening.

Now for the part you're actually here to read! After much trouble I was able to get the project to launch the fxml files. I had to have Andrei and Dr. Goadrich help. Turns out I needed to update my software. Wish I would have known that before I spent an hour trying to make it work/ researching why it wasn't working. I think this is a problem I often have. Anyways always check to make sure your software is up to date. Now the next goal is to change the fxml files by clicking a button. I researched it a little during Wednesday's meeting and I will do a little more after I submit this reflection. Ideally, I will also get the buttons to actually do things too by next meeting.

comment: I keep thinking my work will magically be done everytime I sit down at my computer. I like to think that I finished it and just forgot that I already did it. But alas I have to spend time and get it done.
