This was my busiest week. Possibly my busiest week that I've ever experienced at Hendrix. I had a paper due on Monday, 2 algorithms assignments, 2 exams on friday, and an app due on Wednesday. I don't think I got a reasonable amount of sleep all week. I had to drop some of my extracurriculars like frisbee practice and my workout class just to have a little more time to get things done. I wish I could have a week of rest after that week. Honestly I wouldn't mind having a crazy week if I knew I would have a relaxing week right after. Enough of my woes... here's what you came for.

Disco Tray accomplishments:
- (this one isn't mine but I still want to talk about it.) Part of our team has been tirelessly working on the Career Services game that we hope to give the freshmen. I got to play test it on Wednesday and it's so cool! You can tell that this group really poured their heart and soul into this game. It's pretty representative of Hendrix and really shows the paths you can take while you're here. I think the game is definitely playable for multiple rounds and it's interesting what you can do. My first play through I tried to mimic how I did my freshman year and appearently I got the medium-good ending (I got a good job but not the job of my dreams). I wonder if that's how my life would have played out if COVID never happened. I know I am a definitely a different person compared to freshman year and that is a good thing.
- Arkansas Asset Builders: Similar to last week, Lucy and I have been working on the UI. I have taken the Upload screen adn Lucy has taken the export screen. We still need to make the merge screen. I might do that right now or maybe I'll do that in the morning. Regardless, it will get done. Andrei and Matthew have been working on the project and database set up. I think they too had a busy week and are equally overwhelmed. The goal is to have some working app by monday's meeting. I get most of my work done during the week, I really use my weekends to catch up on sleep and to get to the things that I didn't have time for during the week. That is to say, I think I would have so much more done for Disco Tray if we moved our meetings to not on Monday. That was definitely a weird way to put it but I am worried about what we will have ready by then. Unfortunetly, I can't meet with them before the meeting since I am booked with class.

(will edit later) but I am tired :( I wish things could slow down just a little. Or at the very least I wish I didn't have as much homework every night.
