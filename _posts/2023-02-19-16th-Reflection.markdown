## general info 
So I have kinda a hit a wall with getting the calendar to work. I have gone back and looked at our code and looked through how it works. I was hoping that it would be a easy fix. Like changing one line (maybe making the date a DateTime) or maybe looking at the way the events are sorted. I have definetly tried just messing around with small bits instead of rewriting the code from scratch which may be what I need to do. Also, I was unable to go to this wednesday's meeting because I was not feeling well but I was working on it at the same time (2-4) and messaged with my partners a couple of times to see what the updates were and let them know where I was at.

## meeting with goadrich 
I met with Dr. Goadrich this friday to go over the code. He definetely helped me understand what the new code is doing. So instead of calling firestore in each part of the code we can just do it once in the app state. Doing it this way is definetely more helpful and clean. However, while I do understand this it is different than the examples that I have seen online. I think I will have to meet up with Connor that said he had an idea of where to go. Also Dr. Goadrich told me that he's working on a sharing function so that if you see an event that you like you can send it to friends with a button. Appearently, smart phones already have this function built in and all Dr. G has to do is connect it. I am really excited about this feature. Another update is that I am looking to block out time in my schedule to work on disco. Like say Monday and Friday work from 2-4 because I know that time is free. It's just hard because I feel like I have no time and I am constantly running from thing to thing.

## upcoming meeting
Lucy scheduled another meeting with Hendrix Today people for next thursday at 3pm. This will be helpful to show them what we have and see what they think of Lucy's idea of tags. Tags would be helpful for searching for events or types of events that you think would be useful. There are also a couple of other stretch goals that wee want to see if they will be interested in. I will update the next reflection with what we learned from the meeting.
