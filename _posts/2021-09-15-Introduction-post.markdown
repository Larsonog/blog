I definitely thought that this lab would be a lot hard than it was. To be fair, I did make this lab a lot harder than it needed to be. For starters, when there are step by step instructions there is no need to assume that there is a hidden instruction that you are missing. Sometimes everything you need to do for this lab has been nicely laid out for you! However, after all my weird mistakes I now feel confident to help someone else set up their blog. As some famous historical figure once said, "I didn't fail a 1000 times, I found a 1000 ways not to do it." Sometimes you have to make mistakes to get them out of the way before you start your blog.

This lab was also interesting because we had to work with the command prompt which always scares me. It feels like I will crash my laptop beyond repair when I type in commands. However, on the flip side, it also makes me feel like a real computer scientist/ hacker. So this lab had me on the edge of excitement and fear. But once I got to the post writing section of this lab, I felt more at home. I had 2 major struggles with this lab (and those 2 manifested in at least 2 extra hours of frustration and confusion). 1) I kept thinking that I needed to put my blog repository in my larsonog.github.io repo and every time I came up with an error and also ended up with 2 blog repos which would be a part of my other problem: making sure I was doing everything in the correct directory in the command prompt. I was so confused why my Gemfile couldn't be found for the longest time! Turns out I just needed to be in the right directory and Voila! It's there! Like I knew it should be.

I really am looking forward to using this blog and recording my experiences in this class. It's always good to have a reminder of where you first were at so you can see your improvement over time. Also I have a terrible memory so I think it'll be fun to hear things in my voice as they progress through the semester.

In order to finish this assignment I need to include 2 links and a list. So I will make a list of links to things that give me the motivation to go on.

- My [Pintrest Board][Pintrest-Board] for all the things I want to crochet
- A [joke of the day][joke] website that occasionally has a good joke
- A [link][lab2website] to the last website that I made
