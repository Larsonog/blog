 ## Disco 
This week is a lot of catch up on school work as well as disco work. I have officially moved back to Lake Nixon and working on the event times again. Sometimes I feel like my computer is really slow and I get so frustrated with waiting to see if something will work or not. Also update: I will be going to a stem conference next week to present the Water Testing App. It wasn't made by me but I was in the class that worked on it and am the only available person to go to the conference. I will need to start looking at the app to see how it works!

I almost forgot, I had my progress with the Hendrix Today's Resource Page merged into the offical HDX Today app. So go check it out! 

## Frisbee

Also this week the Ultimate Frisbee team will be hosting it's own frisbee tournament called HUX (Hendrix Ultimate eXperience) and there's a lot of background planning and things that I have to help out with. Luckily after this, frisbee should be a lot more chill. I am really glad that I joined this team in college because it has given me a change to workout but in a fun way as well as give me another group of friends that I can count on.

UPDATE:
There was a big tornado that hit Arkansas Friday the 31st of March. One of our teammates had his house demolished by a big tree in his backyard. This Sunday, the Ultimate Frisbee team came out and helped move and cut up tree bits. I am really glad that we could be there for him and help out.
