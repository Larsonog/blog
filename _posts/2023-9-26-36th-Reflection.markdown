## new work plan 
So I have been having a hard time finding the time and energy to get work done for Disco. I guess it's just the wombo combo of working on my Senior Capstone as well as worrying about what I want to do after graduation. To combat this neglect/ get myself into the swing of more productivity, I have made a work plan. In the image below I have laid out what I am doing at each point of the day. This includes classes, meals, and work time for specific topics. I think my problem before was having general work time, in which I would get things done; however, I would not be working on each responsibility equally. I am really hoping this will help.

## things going awry but also working out
So, within the week of my new work plan, I had an unexpected event come up which required me to drop everything and drive up to St. Louis. While I'm glad I went (to celebrate Josh's dad's retirement and Yom Kippur) it certainly made using my work plan more difficult from Sunday to Tuesday. While I wasn't able to work on each responsibily at the time I had planned for, I was able to jump back in the swing of things when I returned to campus at 8pm on Tuesday. 

The font sizing problem should be fixed! I think my problem before was just looking at the issue and code for 30-45 min and getting frustrated when I couldn't find a fix. And when I couldn't find a fix, I moved on to a different task and hoped that my time apart would help me brainstorm. I don't think that really helped in the end but after looking at the code and potential solutions for the 1000th time I finally found a work around. I am using a flutter package to help autosize the text. Orginally, I thought I needed to add a short lien of code to the root of the app to "clamp" the text down into sizes. The way it was presented on stackoverflow was not how our project was set up. So finding a package that allows adding a similar function as the clamp inside the widgets worked better. I'm sure if someone else was looking at this problem they might have solved it much faster and that's fine. I am still learning mobile software development and learned a new way to solve a problem. I'll have to check that my fix works on everyone's devices, but I am so happy to finally have a pull request for this semester. Hopefully more will come!

### pull request 
Other work I have done: checking and merging in pull requests. It's not difficult, but I am happy that I was able to contribute to this project by merging pull requests even when I was struggling to make my own. 

### a new hope 
I am hoping tomorrow (wednesday the 27th) will begin my efficiently productive era. I think I can do it. 
Later I'll update my progress on my capstone project. 

ALSO MY BIRTHDAY IS ON THURSDAY!!! I'm going to be 23! Can't wait :)
