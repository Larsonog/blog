## Community Partners meeting 
During this Disco meeting we met with the community memebers that will be working with the Databases and Websystems class this year. I always love getting to meet with clients and help them figure out what they are looking for as well as let them know what is actually possible. Amelia and I met with a local resources organization that worked with people/families on the brink of homelessness. They are starting a new project and want a database to collect data on who's using their org and how they've been helped (ideally they can show the community all of the money they have saved by not letting these people go into the homeless system) as well as who is donating and how much. I think it's so great how Dr. Goadrich has us working with clients and making things that actually serve a purpose. It just feels very fufilling and it makes me want to continue to do work like this in the future. 

## work 
As for my work, well I haven't gotten much done. I partly blame my laptop. Sometimes it just runs so slowly that I get impatient and stop working on the project. However, I am actively communicating with my team and our clients so I am still locked in and working towards our goal.  More updates to come!
