This lab was another doozy.

Here is the [repository][github] that we created.
My group had to start over on this lab because something had broken beyond repare the first time. The second time we were able to get further into the lab but were still having problems with not being able to progress without weird errors. We were able to get the inital webpage set up with the ToDo list and we were all able to add our names to to the homepage with no problem. We even were able to make the resource group and initalize the remote database. But then... we got locked out of our database and were no longer able to access it. Which was both odd and incredibly confusing. My group and I spent hours trying to get it to work. There were also problems with the IP address and the Hendrix wifi. We joked that Julia drove all the way to Kansas to get it work. In reality she had just gone home early for the break. But even then, with a different IP address, we were still not able to get past that step. Luckily, or maybe unluckily, we weren't the only group having problems. It would have been nice to finish this lab, but with the final due date for our final project approaching we just have higher priorities at the moment and we don't want to host our data in a remote database because we have sensitive information that needs to stay local to the computer.
