# Disco
This reflection post is coming a little late because, to be frank, I forgot. Ha! Anyways this is what's new with disco for this semester. We recently aquired more projects from the mobile software class. This is really nice because I was in that class and know all of the projects and their goals well. It's been really nice watching projects grow and develop over the course of the semseter. Appearently, the Arkansas Asset Builders code is close to being done and will be finished up by Matthew and Andrei. Last I heard they think they can finish it in 2 weeks. I have moved to the Hendrix Today app (which is the same project I worked on in the mobile class). Our goals for this first week of picking it up was to get it running and find more issues we think need to be addressed and add it to this list of issues. We've also been dividing up tasks. Connor's big task is to get firebase to fully cooperate, I am working with the calendar page, and Lucy is getting the events on the homepage to disappear once thier time has passed. I think we will be a good group and hopefully finish up the app soon. I know a lot of people would really like to have it.

# Other news
My group and I are finally going to present the documentary we made on cafe culture in europe. We had to postpone it a lot due to finishing up other projects but it's happening tonight! Here's the cover art I made for the event. I'll update the blog once I know how the event goes.

Also I think this semester is going to go really well. I think the vibes feel right about it. Also I am really exicited to be doing background dancing in Miss Hendrix (however, we will see what happens because of the bill that is trying to get passed). 

# Update
The documentary showing went super well! We had about 10 students show up and they all really seemed to like it. Also Hendrix Communications asked us to make a tik tok for the event and I crafted, directed, and edited the perfect tik tok. Ok well it might not be perfect but I am proud of it nontheless. I've never uploaded a video on here so I'm not sure how this will go. Also I'll go ahead and link the doc too!
