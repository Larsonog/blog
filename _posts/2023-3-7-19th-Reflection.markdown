# Resources Page 

We had a set back with some code we were waiting on so I moved back to the hendrix today app. During our last meeting, the hendrix today folks meantioned that they wanted a Resources page. This would include PSAFEs phone number, where the lost and found is, and a link to submit to the Hendrix Today form. During our meeting I set up a page and started on adding those elements. I was able to find a way that if you click on the PSAFE button it takes you to your call screen with their number already dialed (this was really cool to figure out). I also was able to add the link to the hdx today form pretty easily too. Right now I am looking to make the whole page look better and overall prettier. I think I need to look around at other app's resources page to see what they did to make it look better. I currently am using cards and list tiles but I just think there has to be a better way. I will update next week after I keep messing around with it more. 

# My Life
I recently participated in Miss Hendrix as a backup dancer for my good friend. Thier drag persona was Seyonce (the undead version of Beyonce) and we spent a long time practicing to get the dance down. Tech week (the week before the big performance) required a lot of time and there were many hours spent in staples making sure the timing of the show was correct. Anyways the actual Miss Hendrix was amazing and every performer and their group was awesome. I am so happy that I was able to participate in this because it is so important not ust for Hendrix but to show up Arkansas legislators and thier Anti-drag bill.
