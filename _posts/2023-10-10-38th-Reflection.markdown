This was the week of Fall break. A much needed break! I think I really need to focus on relaxing because I realized that I usually function in a very stressful state most of the time (eg I've been very overwhelmed with coursework, my capstone, and also trying to figure out what I am going to do after college). I am hoping to get outdoors and see the sun more! Taking care of ourselves is super important because if we don't then we just fall apart and I really need to be able to regroup so I can take on the 2nd half of the semester.
