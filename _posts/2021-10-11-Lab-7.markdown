Lab 7 has been one of the most frustrating labs of all time. I am not happy with it. After the tutorial I thought I had a bit of an understanding of how to make a Razor Pages application. After 3 hours and countless errors, I have decided to give up briefly. Maybe once I get back to my apartment I will try again.
To answer the prompt:
  the tutorial kinda blended together and was a whirlwind of copying and pasting for me. The only part I didn't understand was when it asked us to add a break in the code. I tried to go back and figure out what it meant but could not.

  It started off pretty easy translating the steps of the tutorial into making my own application. It was initially working on my local server until it wasn't and I got a whole host of SQL errors.

  I like jekyll so much more! I like that there is less adding different pieces of code to different files. I think that part of the Razor Pages experience was the most infuriating.

  I will feel more confident in making a Razor Pages Application when I can find out why I am getting this silly little error.

  Here's the link to my [Github repository][repo]. Maybe it will have fixed itself?

  Also my application is about avocados! I recently started enjoying them and I thought it would be fun to create a database about which ones I've had

  Also here is a visual image to how this lab made me feel:
