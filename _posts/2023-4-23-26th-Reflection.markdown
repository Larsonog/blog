This week we got to play Tempest Winds. It was really cool getting to see my art in the game. ALSO this has ignited a flame in me. I want to make a video game this summer. I don't know what it's going to be yet, but it's going to be amazing and it's all I want to think about and plan but alas, I need to finish up work for the summer. 
During our meeting we play tested the game and found several bugs but overall I think their game is going to be so good. Dr. Goadrich also got IPads for the department, this will be great for more playtesting in the future. I also have been thinking about getting an IPad. I have a Kindle Tablet right now it can kinda do the job of an IPad but not really. Sometimes it's a little unusable but I'm still really grateful to have it. It's been great for class and my digital art. 

In other news, I did not get much done on my Where Is? function. Next week is our final meeting and Dr. Goadrich told me to just focus on the basics of it and submit a pull request by the next meeting. I will do this, I am determined!
