# Lake Nixon Firebase 
This new project is really intimidating in comparison to the Hendrix Today app. This app has so many moving parts and variables with similar names. With the Lake Nixon app, we need to be able to make a schedule that has at least 10 groups, each with thier own restrictions (age restrictions mostly) and activities. Connor had to spend most of our Wednesday meeting with Lucy and I going over each files and the important parts that we would mostly likely be editing/working with. Now my goal is to hard code in event times so that events can't be added at 9:01 but rather just on the hour like 9:00. Another important part of this app is that we definetley need to make a webversion just for the master calendar/ admin becuase currently the master calendar on the app is so overwhelming and unreadable. So the combination of having a webversion as well as hard coding the the possible event times will greatly help with accidently errors. I will also start looking at adding in a function where you can see how many groups have been added to an event and will stop you once you reach capacity. Again, these are just some small things that will help a lot with scheduling. I also found a lot of places where we can fix up the app for the users point of view. It'd be mostly UI stuff like sizing things based on the user's screen size. I will provide the github repo below just in case anyone wants to follow along on our progress.
