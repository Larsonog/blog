This is a busy week for me. I am still working on Lake Nixon stuff. I believe I know where in the code I need to mess with to make 'add to calendar' function only accept hourly and maybe 30 minutes as inputs so that you don't accidently add the same event twice; one at 1:00 and one at 1:01. 

I need to look at the Water Testing app soon because I will be presenting it on April 6th. I do kinda remember what it does from last semester when the group working on it would present their progress during class but I don't think I remember everything. I may try to get into contact with the creators to make sure I know how everything works. I also need to figure out the plans for the conference and what is expected of me.
