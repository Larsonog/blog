Well I thought the landing page was done but I was wrong. This time instead of using my own css style sheet I used a premade one from Bootstrap and it definetely better and reacted better to different sizes. I guess I should have done that all along but I wanted more controll over how the page looked. 

To make sure the page was truly finished I met with Dr. Goadrich for an hour and we quickly finished everything up! I think that was the fastest I have ever coded! 

We should be announcing the releasing the app soon!!! It's out on the Apple app store but not on the Andriod store. I believe it's because when they tried to test it they were either using a VPN or someone from a differnt country was trying to test it. The authentication of the app did not like that so it gave errors. Dr. Goadrich is working hard to get everything sorted out. 

Also, I heard from Dr. Goadrich that we've made lots of table tents to leave around campus. I've also already told people to start downloading the app and so far people love it!!!
