While I was out of town for most of the summer, I am excited to be back and working with Disco Tray Studios again this summer. While I was gone Simon, Teddy, and Dr. Goadrich got a lot of work done on the Hendrix Today and Lake Nixon App. Both apps are almost done so I've been told to start looking at the Water Quality Testing app. Luckily I already know a little about it since I presented the app to some young students for an event that Dr. Hill and Dr. Hatch were invited to. I am little nervous getting back in the swing of things but I'm sure I'll figure it out! 

# Small mishaps I've already had
- I deleted Visual Studio. Ha! When class ended this last semester I was doing a deletion marathon to free up some space on my laptop. I for some reason didn't link in my head that Visual Studio Code (the software we are using for our Mobile Development) needed Visual Studios (a software I used in my Databases and Websystems class). Anyways, I had to redownload that and it took forever! 
- I thought I broke the Water Quality Testing App! But I didn't! I wasn't even working on the correct app! -- but I wouldn't find that out until 4 hours later. I realized that I was still looking at the app that my Mobile Software Development classmates had made and not the one that Disco had forked. This is important because Simon and Teddy made some key pushes that I needed to have on my end. 

After these two minor mishaps and many many hours later I am now ready to start making some progress on the Water Quality Testing app! I will being going through the issues and pick one to start working on this week. I think I want to start with the UI. Lately I have gotten really annoyed with bad UIs that are confusing to understand and navigate so hopefully I will be able to make a difference on this app so it's super user friendly.
