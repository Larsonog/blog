Oh my goodness it is my last semester here at Hendrix! I am equally excited and afraid for what lies after college. I am starting to apply to jobs in St.Louis. However, I don't know if that's where I will end up. 

For Disco work, I have made substantial progress on the app landing page for the Hendrix Today app. I am excited to show the school what we've been working on this whole time. I know there are a lot of people ready to start using this app. I basically made a new html page with my own css style sheet. The page looks okay but it's not popping like the app landing page for the Good Vibes app. Unfortunetly I can't just steal that template and change the words,images, and colors for the Hendrix Today webpage because the Good Vibes web page was made for jekyll and is in markdown. So crafting an html page by scrap was a little time consumming. The only thing I wish I had done differently was if I sketched out and debated with Jonathan what the page should look like before diving head first into coding. It wasn't too bad but it was just a lot of trial and error. Hopefully, at our meeting tomorrow Jonathan and Dr. Goadrich can tell me 2 tiny things that I need to adjust to make the page ready. 

Also this has been the week of sickness in my family. My parents just had to leave town to visit their friend who's not doing too well health wise, and then my sister started to not feel well. I had to go home and take care of her while my parents were away. Hopefully she either goes to the doctor or starts to feel better soon!
