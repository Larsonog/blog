## general updates 
Since we have made substantial progress on hendrix today app, we are going to put it down for a little bit. We now are going to work on the Lake Nixon app. This app definetely is more complicated than the hendrix today app. It has 2 sides to it, the admin side with the master calendar and the user side where parents and conselers can check the calendar. The master calendar is basically unusable on the mobile app, so we are looking to make it into a flutter webpage. Also I think it is important to meantion that one file has over 3000 lines of code but there was only a couple of hunderd lines of code that should be edited. Lucy's job is to seperate the code again to make it more usable. My job is to hard code in event time blocks and show how many groups are in an event (like 3/4 spots are filled for this event). I am kinda worried about being able to understand this code but Connor has been open to explaining what everything is and what it does. I also found a couple of smaller things that could be updated for the user but I think we will do that after getting the big things done. Hopefully we can finish it up and move back to the hendrix today app and do some testing by the end of the semester. 

## hendrix today meeting updates 
Here are the notes that I took during the meeting 
- email sponsor for events --- be able to click email and have it take you to your email
- notifications for new hdx updates
- if someone is on top of things, and submit the event a week before it wants to run
- tags are good but lets get basebones working
- want to check to make sure not just anyone can put things into communications
- dynamic text size or dark mode
- could lean in to logging in to access the app -- helicopter parents = bad
    - add it for now
    - gives opportunity for admin privileges
- tags -- recitals, lectures, club meetings
- resource info -- public safety number, where lost and found is, etc -- could take you to submissions form there too

I can definetely explain more of this later but I feel like this is self explanitory. Basically, they gave us more ideas for things they could want as well as possible use cases or things that could happen that we should consider. 

## general stressors 
This upcoming week will be very stressful. Miss Hendrix is this saturday and every day this week we are rehersing. On thursday we have the athlete's show and have to perform the show 2 times that day. Anyways it's a lot of time but after that I should have more time to get things done.
