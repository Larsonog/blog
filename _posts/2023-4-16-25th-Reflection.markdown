I am really interested in the Game Dev part of Disco and hopefully will be working with them in the future. Last week, I heard them talking about asking someone to draw the characters for their game Tempest Winds. It sounded like they were going to outsource the work but I offerred to try my hand it instead. I was super okay if they didn't like my style I just thought it would be fun to contribute to their project. It turns out digitial art takes me a long time to create. It's something new that I have been trying this semester starting with being an artist for Dr. Pfau's Odyssey project (Medieval French Crime Letters). It was really fun to create and I went ahead and sent them my rough sketches. For now they have put in my work but it's extremely possible they might switch to a different artist. At somepoint I might add my sketches to my blog but that will take too much effort right now. If you're looking at this post before next fall, my art might still be in their game (which can be found on itch.io I think). 

I also have moved back to the HDX Today app. My goal is adding to the Where Is? function. I need to make sure the information is accurate and I'm thinking it might be helpful to include a map. I think seeing landmarks would be a nice addition. However, we will see how much work will get done because the semester is ending and I am panic mode of making sure everything gets done. 

UPDATE: Here are my sketches
