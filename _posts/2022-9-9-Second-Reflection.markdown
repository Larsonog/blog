This is my second week of working with Disco Tray Studios. This week we only met once because of Labor Day. During our Wednesday meeting we decided that it would be best to drop Visual Studios as our software for this project. We now will be using JavaFX. I have worked with this software before but definitely need a reminder of how to use it. I believe Andrei will initiate the project and the rest of my team and start building a demo we can use by our next meeting on Monday.

After this week I have a good understanding that I have a lot of work that I will have to do this semester. Algorithms homework requires at least 4 hours to work on as well as multiple meeting with Dr. Yorgey and classmates. My Mobile software Development class requires a similar amount of time. I also have a lot of extracurricular activities that I may have to put on hold/ put in the backseat while I try and complete more pressing projects.
