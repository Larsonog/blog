This week I started moving on to other projects. I went ahead and forked the other current projects so I could approve pull requests if needed. I was able to get the Faulkner County Juvenile Court website to run but not Family Promise. It might be a problem with which version of .Net is being used. I'll let that group update the website to the .Net8 and then I'll try getting it to run on my laptop again. 

I went ahead and emailed Lynita, from the Faulkner County Museum, about meeting. The group before me never got to show her the final version of the website. I want to show her and get some feedback before I start making lots of changes. 

For now I need to remember how .Net websites work, so I am working through a tutorial. A lot of it is coming back to me already. That's one thing that I like about the Hendrix Comp Sci program. We learn a lot of different things but most importantly we learn how to learn things. I feel like I can pick up a lot of new skills just because I know how I should go about learning them.

Anyways, Lynita said she cannot meet with me for 2 weeks. I sent her my availbility and she should be getting back to me soon. I also need to get the images from her to put on the website.

For now I will continue going through documentation, listing issues for my project, and helping out with the other group's pull requests.
