This is only coming late because of some technical difficulties (both snow days taking out power and wifi as well as laptop being slow)

Anyways this week (snow days and all) as been focused at getting the calendar to be connected with the firestore. I think since I am having trouble with it right now, I'll switch over and complete one of the smaller tasks just to get it done and to remind myself that I can in fact complete coding things. 

This week has also been a little crazy because I am one of the student managers at the information desk in the SLTC and we have 1 too many people working here so we have to change up the schedules every week to make sure everyone is getting an even amount of hours. Also our method of recording hours is by paper and so counting them up at the end of the month is very difficult and probably takes around 2ish hours. This upcoming week should be a little easier since I do not have to make the schedule. 

I will have another reflection soon, I will update chaos and my progress then. 

Also this is my first time using VSCode to write a blog post. I had been using Atom but I had no space on my laptop so I thought I would consolidate. Anyways see you soon blog people!
