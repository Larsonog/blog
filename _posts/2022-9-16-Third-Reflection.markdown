Oh man oh man. I am currently going through a crisis of motivation. I love to code and create
projects but instead of spending my spare time working on disco tray things I'm doing anything but that.
Definitely going to have to make some major changes to my time management. It's just hard because
I feel like I am always doing things and in my spare time I really just want to do
my little hobbies like crochet and hang out with friends. Regardless, I have made a committment to
Disco Trays and I live up to it. So Dr. Goadrich, if you are reading this, don't worry I am on the case.

Now that my little rant is over I will talk about the things I have done this week with Disco Trays.
Andrei made the project earlier that week through a Maven extension. We all had to sit down and try
to figure out what was supposed to go in all the directories. I reviewed what we had done in Data Structures
with javafx and even found my battleship game that I made as my final project. This project set up
made a lot of sense to me. Anyways we had to scrap the project Andrei had made and will be
setting up a new one. I will have to check to see if it's more like what I am familiar with. We've also
been working on splitting up the work. I believe Lucy and I will primarily be handling the GUI/UI interfaces,
Matthew will be working on reconnecting the database and Andrei is also doing behind the scenes work.

Another little rant about myself. I think I have noticed that it's really hard for me to work on
something unless I am passionate about it, like if it sparks something in my brain. But my brain isn't always consistant though. There are so many things that I should hypothetically like to do and spend hours on (like with my crochet project or other general things) but sometimes I just can't convince myself to do fun things or work. I don't know why my brain is like this. I wish I could just flip the switch in my brain to turn on my productivity but it feels impossible sometimes. Anyways ARGGGGG. I think this is just a beginning of the semester crisis and once I get back in the swing of being ultra productive this wont be a problem. Again I would like to reiterate ARGGGGGGGGG.

-- i am counting on no one reading this blog ever. I will probably edit the heck out of these posts later so they sound less chaotic.
-- also josh and I have a really cool idea for an app. It would be like a shared to do list that couples or friends could use. The to do list would be divided into categories like School Tasks, Non-School Tasks, and Fun. Josh and I like to plan out our days by letting eachother know what we have to do. School tasks are always top priority and non-school stuff (like doing laundry or cleaning) are secondary priorities. The fun category is for when we both feel good enough about our completion of tasks we want to know what fun activiy each of us would like to do. It's just a great way to know what the other person has to do rather than just guessing. There are shared to do lists that already exist but we want to make ours much cuter. Ideally each user would have a character (i.e. a fox or a raccoon) and thier tasks would be labled with their character. Maybe when they complete their task their character does a little dance. I don't know but it would be so cute and it's something that Josh and I would definitely use.
