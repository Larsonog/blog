# Discussion

### Entity Relationship drawing
I think I did the entity relationship and schema drawings correctly. I started off by thinking about what the entities could be. Thinking back to an example we did in class with sailors, crews, boats, and reservations, I tried to emulate that. That's why I think that 'orders' should be its own entity. Its something a customer can do and it consists of food items. There is a one to one relationship between the customer to their order but and order can have many food items. A customer is also identified with their name, phone number, and address.

### Schema
Unfortunetly I could not remember how to add the FK (Foreign Key) to the order table. However I know it's suppose to be there. The order needs these id numbers to be accurate. I'm excited to actually start using SQL files and sorting through databases!

### Complications with implementing this model
We've been talking about Normal Forms and their importance. I think if I were to implement this model it would be easy to mess up one of the colomns and ruin the order.

### Conculsion
This did require some thought and I did change my mind a couple of times about what the entities really were. I originally had the store as an entity instead of the order. I decided that was not the way to go because of the way the class approached the boat problem. I am also having a hard time figuring out how to include local images on my blog. I have no problem getting images from the internet published but I am sure I am not directing it to the right path and that's why it's not working. I think I'll go ahead and publish this now and then hopefully come back to it later tonight and have it figured out.
