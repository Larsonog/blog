#### Thoughts about the future 
This was a very busy week for me. Perhaps every week is a busy week for me. I can't believe the semester is coming to a close. I am so afraid. Well maybe afraid isn't the right word. Is it possible to feel concept of afraid without actually feeling afraid? Ha! This is silly because I am in Emotions class for my psych minor. According to some theories, an emotion can be what ever you want to label them as. I think it's also dawning on me that I have to graduate soon and I'm going into a new sector of my life. I think it's ok to be afraid of change but also recognize that you can't pause your life. Change has to happen. Even though I am scared to leave, I don't think I could stay another year at college. It's time that I move on. But also at the same time AAA!

### Disco 
As for Disco, I am still looking into the disabling the alertDialog box. I just feel like if I sat down for a consequative amount of time I could figure it out. Just with the way school is right now, I have to move on an work on other assignments. I think I may reach out to another team member and see if they can help out or at the very least have any ideas as to how I should go about this.
