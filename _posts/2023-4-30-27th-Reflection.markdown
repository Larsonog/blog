This was our last meeting! I am so sad! It's been so great working with Disco Tray Studios this semester. Luckily, I will also get the opportunity to continue working with them in the Summer. 

This week's accomplishment: getting the Where Is? function working! And I think I did it in a clever way. It's called being good at what I do. However, as I was adding the maps (AND MAKING THE MAPS ZOOMABLE!) I realized that the floor plans are not accurate. I'm not sure what I will do about this now, but in the future I might try to edit them to make them correct. 

OH! Another accomplishment (in a different field). I recently presented my work for a differnt Odyssey project. This project was in partnership with Dr. Gantz and we went to Alaska. The goal was to create educational materials for K-12. I teamed up with another member in this Odyssey group and we created an activity book about 4 different National Parks in Alaska. I have done all of the digitial art for this as well (there will be more than 30 pages of my art). I'll have some more time after finals to finalize and finsih everything but it has been so fun to make this. I'll add some images from it below. 

While I'm sad we had our last meeting, I am kinda glad because there's so much work left for me to do in such a short amount of time.
