# Health
What a week what a week. Currently there is a cold going around campus and I have definitely contracted it. I am the definition of snot and sinus discomfort. Anyways, we are reaching the end of the semester and I am rushing to try and finish up all the things I need to finish up. I definitely did this to myself. I struggle to find the middle ground between having fun and being happy and getting work down. However, even when I am 'having fun', I am still stressed deep down and probably am not having as much fun as I could be if I wasn't so worried about completing everything.

# Disco
In disco I am still working with the GUI. Surprisingly SceneBuilder is not very nice with design and things don't look that aesthetically pleasing. I think I might be able to import a css file (I think that's the right thing I'll double check that later) and change up the design a little. Otherwise, Andrei and I are working on getting the upload button to upload the selected file into the database. From what I understand, only one part of the parser works. I wonder if we will be able to make enough progress before the end of the semester.

# Stress
I'll end this by saying that I am very stressed :(
