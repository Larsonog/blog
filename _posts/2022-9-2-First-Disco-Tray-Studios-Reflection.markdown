Friday Reflection:

This was my first full week working with Disco Tray Studios. I'm really excited
to work with this group of students. We assigned 2 different projects to the group.
Part of the group is working on a game/ Renpy simulator for Career Services. From
what I can tell the project looks mostly done and really cool. I worked with Renpy last
semester in my Computational HUmanities class. I made a visual novel (which is what
Renpy makes) of a raccoon trying to find its place in the Hendrix feral cat community.
Visual novels are really cool because, while it reads like a graphic novel, the user
can make choices that impact the story. With the visual novel the other group is making, I think
they are trying to simulate a first day of college. I will have to ask them more about their project.
I know they are trying to get it ready for Exploration classes to use soon.

The group I am working with is working with Arkansas Asset Builders (a free tax help organization).
It's really cool because I was in a group 2 semesters ago that originally started this project.
Although I have some insight, I needed a reminder of what AAB needed so I set up a
meeting for my group and Joyia Yorgey. We met with her this Friday and discussed what
she needed out of a software. I took lots of notes and put it in my groups shared file folder.
What's nice about this [file folder][folder] is that it was started the first time my group started
working on this project and so it has a lot of notes and diagrams for this group to refer to.
Currently we are all trying to get the original code to run on our laptops as well as trying
to decide if we just want to fix up this project or revamp it with another software.
I think when we meet again on Wednesday (because this Monday is Labor Day) we will have it figured out how we want to approach it as well as divving out tasks for the week.
