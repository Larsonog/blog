## This week!

This week we met with Dr. Hatch, one of the two professors we are working with for the Water Quality Testing app. 

### Notes
#### Here are my notes from the meeting:
- change the instructions to say put the white at the bottom 
- say that we have varified this in a certain amount of accuracy 
- need location
	- when you give permission for location it just automatically records it with results 
- include information about what the levels mean 
	- why is that important 
	- push the red flag 
	- health risks 
- likes the map -> for the users: how do my results compare to people around me 
- need units on results screen 
- results: compare number to epa limit -> then click on the flag to know what that means 
- "lets upload data, get the data, then inform them"
- record what type of water source is it: well water, surface water, drinking water!!!!
	- before they take the picture select what the water source 	is 
	- somewhere where they could put a description of it 
	- eg water from basement, outdoor tap, pond but it just 	rained 
	- make sure it's clear that we are measuring drinking 	water
		- give disclaimer if they select something other 		than drinking water 
			- just looking for what is safe to drink 			not safe to swim in 
- storage original image: did they take a picture without a black ground/ why are numbers so off 
- website: instructions how to do it, how to get test strips, a map to see where tests have been reported 
- for the camp: data is important: maybe they want to look at led levels and all the drinking water in little rock. Where are the hotspots of just led
	Data needed:
	- results, type of water, location, date and time 

## In Summary 

#### To sum it up/ what we are hoping to accomplish before the summer is over:
    - Add EPA standards into the results page
        - This app is supposed to be a learning/educational. People should know what it means to have elements at different levels in their water. 
    - Add a description page of the water source
        - It is important to know what the source is. It it actual drinking water or is it pond water? Is it water from your kitchen tap or water from your basement tap you never use. Also she wants us to add a disclaimer that if the water is not supposed to be drinking water then we should say we are only testing it by drinking water standards. 
        - I am going to change up the UI once more to make it a directional set of steps that must be completed. 

#### What we hope to accomplish in the fall:
    - Add the map back in! 
        - Dr. Hatch thinks it's important for people to see what the water quality is like around them. 
        - This will be a little tricky for privacy reasons. We don't want to be too precise with locations. We are thinking of making it regional data (maybe by zip codes?)

Next week we are hosting a ribbon cutting ceremony for our new sponsor Blue Cross Blue Shield. We will be presenting the work that we have done over the summer and the school year. I am excited to show people what we have done!
