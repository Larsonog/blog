I think the most difficult part of the tutorial was just getting it started.
I always get a little confused about how to integrate the .NET and
the Github repo. But I was able to figure it out. It was also important to
start from the beginning and not take their example web app. I made the
name of mine Halloween Spooky University 2 because Halloween is coming and it
is my favorite holiday. It was also frustrating when I was trying to follow
the tutorial and they wanted you to copy code into the command prompt
and the code had something for Contoso University and it would add Contoso
University everywhere in the project and I had to go back and change
each one. Otherwise I found it really easy to insert the Age and the W and I into
the grades. I am still currently working on sorting the student page by
Age, LastName, and Date. I thought I'd go ahead and make a post tonight and then I
can update my blog tomorrow or even later tonight when I figure it out.
I'm not sure how to begin sorting things. Luckily/Unluckily my group is also
working on this part of the lab/ are a little behind. So I am not alone in my struggles.
I will contact them more and maybe we can brainstorm how to go about it.

Until then... heres a cute picture of cat:
