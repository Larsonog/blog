IMPORTANT UPDATE:
THERE IS ANOTHER UPDATE TO THE UPDATE

I think the most difficult part of the tutorial was just getting it started.
I always get a little confused about how to integrate the .NET and
the Github repo. But I was able to figure it out. It was also important to
start from the beginning and not take their example web app. I made the
name of mine Halloween Spooky University 2 because Halloween is coming and it
is my favorite holiday. It was also frustrating when I was trying to follow
the tutorial and they wanted you to copy code into the command prompt
and the code had something for Contoso University and it would add Contoso
University everywhere in the project and I had to go back and change
each one. Otherwise I found it really easy to insert the Age and the W and I into
the grades. I am still currently working on sorting the student page by
Age, LastName, and Date. I thought I'd go ahead and make a post tonight and then I
can update my blog tomorrow or even later tonight when I figure it out.
I'm not sure how to begin sorting things. Luckily/Unluckily my group is also
working on this part of the lab/ are a little behind. So I am not alone in my struggles.
I will contact them more and maybe we can brainstorm how to go about it.

Until then... heres a cute picture of cat:

UPDATED CONTENT:
I have finished all 8 steps of the tutorial. I didn't realize that there were 8 steps yesterday. I was also able to complete all the required steps for step 2 for our lab. However, I guess I haven't technically completed it because right now it doesn't work. I have tried going back through the tutorial and rechecking that I completed all the steps correctly (and I have) but everytime I try step 4 to create the "initial migration" I get an error that says the Course table already exists. Initally I tried to move on and hoped that it wouldn't be that big of a problem. Well I finished the tutorial and believe it or not, my ASP.NET page did not work. I am getting very frustrated. I'm happy that I figured out how to add in the Age field and sort by it.
I also have learned how to add everything else in from the tutorial (courses, instructors, etc). It's weird, I was able to get somethings to pull up but other pages I would just get migration erros. I feat that the only way I will successfully complete this lab is if I start from the beginning beginning and I truly believe that will make me go a little crazy. On the bright side I have a better idea of how to use ASP.NET pages and am excited(ish) to start on my final project. I know with our project my team will have to design the database similar to how we made them in this lab. I'm not quite sure how we will input the data, because in these last two labs we manually put it in.

I think I will start over from the very very beginning so I can get this lab to work. However, I will not be happy about. In fact I will be very grumpy while doing it. But I know how important it is to have this lab completed.
Until then, Dr. G if you are looking at my relection post, here is my [Github link][repo]

2nd UPDATE:
I am done. That was a lot of work and really tested my patience. I have finished this lab at 2 am out of pure spite. I didn't want to have to worry about it this weekend. I do see how it'll be helpful for the final project. That is all. My eyes would like to stop staring at my laptop. Over and out.
(also I think this lab took me around 6 hours to complete maybe a little more)
I ALMOST FORGOT! Here is the new [Github repository][repo2] that has the completed lab. After completing this lab I think I might have been able to solve the errors I was getting the first time I did it but I also think it was beneficial to start over and make sure I really knew what I was doing.
