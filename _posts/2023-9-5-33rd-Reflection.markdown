## THIS WEEK 

We split up the tasks and projects for the beginning of the semester. I will be working on finishing up Hendrix Today. Luckily Simon and Dr. Goadrich did a great job of finishing up all the loose threads of the project and what is left for me and Isaac shouldn't take the whole semester. Isaac and I met with the Communications office on Tuesday to see if they had any questions or concerns about the app. From what I gathered at the meeting it mostly sounds like they need to try working with the webuploader for a little bit before they have any questions. 

Here's my notes from the meeting:
## HDX today meeting notes
- they will mess with the links 
- resend invitations to paige and rob -- done

INTERESTING 
- uploader website: took a while to upload and delete 
- if someone has a question; should there be a button? If there is      a correction, duplicate events, etc  
  - on the card screen= item specific 
  - on resources screen: submit a correction and it sends you to 
    hdxtoday email 
	- email not consistently monitored throughout the day 
  - they will think about what they want 
- don't want to see any old events -- make it consistent

ISSUES 
- if phone font is bigger than normal it shows up weird on the
  resources page 
	- max text size 	
- adding to calendar is just all day 
- changing event titles when it day of
- duplicate events like Odyssey Murphy funding- on Calendar page


I really enjoy taking notes during meetings because even if it is something small that is said that I'm sure I will rememeber, it's nice just having notes to refer back to. 

I was able to add a couple more issues to the repo which can be found here: [Hendrix Today repo](https://github.com/DiscoTrayStudios/hendrix-today)

Now what's next for me is looking into the changing font size. I guess this is why you always test apps with a wide range of people because in all the testing we had done up to this point we hadn't noticed the bug of if the phone's default font size is bigger than usual. I tested it out on my end and sure enough that does cause a problem. This should be an easy fix but I think it might be nice to have some adjustibilty to the font size just in case people need it to be bigger.

## Disco and Thoughts
Hopefully today during our meeting we will get to play test Jonathon's games. I really love the process of making games and I hope I will get to hop onto one of those projects once I finish up with Hendrix Today. The game Jonathon needs to finish up is for Career Services. It's more a less a simulation game made through RenPy where you act as a first year student and make decisions about college life along the way. In the end you find out whether or not you got the internship. One aspect I really like about the game is that the goal isn't just to study all the time or to join too many extraciriculars but rather to have a more rounded experience. Every aspect of college is important. And this ranges from spending time with friends so you can decompress from class or choosing to go to some college events. After taking a couple of Psych classes I really have learned the importance of taking care of yourself as well as how the brain works. Honestly, I think everyone should be required to take Psych classes. It's all so interesting and it makes everything I do make sense. I hope to bring this perspective into my coding.
