So on April 6th I went to the "STEM Conference", it was not a STEM conference. It turned out to be a STEM Showcase at a middle school. BUT it wasn't really middle schoolers but more so elementary schoolers. I don't think Dr. Hatch or Dr. Hill was prepared for it. Also, what we were there to primarily present on was Environmental Justice in Arkanasas. I helped Dr. Hatch present the molecules exhibit and we got to scare many kids by telling them that we are breathing in thousands of particles and and some of them are not very good. Anyways, besides leaving at 7:30 am with Dr. Hill to help set up, I had a good time and got to show off the Water Testing App. I hope the kids were interested in what I was saying and not just focused on getting a free pinwheel (luckily Dr. Hatch happened to have a lot of pinwheels in her office that she brought). Also the goal of this showcase for the HDX folks was to show the Little Rock school district that we are willing to be symbiotic partners (I can't think of the right word). Dr. Hill and Dr. Hatch want to work with the school district and they haven't had much luck but they are hoping that by attending this showcase that it will show that they are willing to work with the school district and therefore the district should work with them. If they ever make a website for thier project I will link it below. 

This was the biggest part of my week, mostly because I had to wake up so early and stay for 3 hours. I hope Dr. Hill and Dr. Hatch like me, I certainly liked them a lot and hopefully will either get to work with them again or take a class of theirs.
