## Not my best week
Not my best week for getting things done for Disco but I have been very active with working for Dr. Pfau and her Odyssey project. I currently am an artist for her Medieval Crime website and have been working with the student researchers to illustrate the medieval letters. I really like her project because it's designed with accessibility in mind. She wants to make a website for students and any other researchers to use to delve into medieval french crime letters. This summer I was able to go with her to France to see some of the locations in person. It was amazing. I really love working with different professors, I think it's making me more of a well rounded individual
