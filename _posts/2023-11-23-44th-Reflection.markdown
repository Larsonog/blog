This week I finally figured out how to disable the alertDialog box (with Jonathon's help). It took lots of trial and error but turns out the best way to do it was through the sharedPreferences function. It store information locally so it can remember it later when the app is reopened. Brilliant! 

We also met with our Hendrix Today clients and showed them how to send out notifications. Here are my notes from the meeting;

#### Questions and answers 
- Expanding how much you can see on the calendar page 
	Go ahead!
- Thinking about how to sort events with deadlines 
	An event for both the deadline and the event on the calendar 
- Dismissing events on the home page 
    Still want to talk about it 
	Tentative green light
- Allowing the people outside the Hendrix community to see public events (and only public events) 
    Maybe?
- Delay while we talk to IT about Hendrix being the developer for the app
- Issues for the uploader:
    Be able to delete posts from the app
#### Issues:
- Add to calendar not working (iPhone)

Next week is Thanksgiving and I am driving up to Vermont to visit my brother. It takes 22 hours to get there and I am hoping to get some work done on the drive. We will see! 
Also with app, we are hoping to deploy it out to the Hendrix population in the spring! I can't wait for everyone to see it!
