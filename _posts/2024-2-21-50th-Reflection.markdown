The meeting with Lynita went well and I will be meeting with her again on Monday @ 2:30. She has a lot of the pictures of the artwork ready to put into the database but they currently are not matched up with the information. 

Anyways, as for my disco update for this past week, I was very busy this weekend. I ran up to St. Louis and believe it or not but they had lots of snow! And I even saw 2 people get into car accidents due to their loss of traction on the road. Crazy! Long story short, after graduation, I'm moving up to St. Louis. 

This week, I will be attempting to add in the artwork and the correct corresponding information but I'll have to make some guesses. Also I will be making sure she is the only one to have access to the admin side of the website.Â Otherwise I will be helping out with other projects issues and pull requests.
