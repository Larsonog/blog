After setting up ruby and completing the previous lab, this was pretty easy! I had a couple of frustrating moments that were easily solved by fixing a few typos (for example fixing post.html to posts.html). It really does make a difference!

Similar to this thumb with a smiley face on it, things are going well for me right now. Since I have finished this lab early, I may attempt the optional step at the end. This step essentially helps me go beyond the minima theme. I can choose a [Jekyll Blog Template][Jekyll] and fork it on [my Github][Github] to access the *style*.

I also wanted to include this frog. It symbolically represents how relaxed I was while completing this lab. I think I finished this lab in either 1.5 hours or 2 hours. It's hard to tell. I took many a break to walk around, get brain food, and answered some emails in between!
