# Disco Updates!
So my Arkansas Asset Builders project just started working. So this was the first week that I was able to make some small progress. I created a button that lets you move between the 2 fxml files (Success!) and a button that lets you open your file explorer. This is a good start and will be helpful for Andrei when he parses file info into the database. Next step is looking to save the file path ( the C:\Users..... ). Also I will need to make a commit to Github but I am worried that my work will crash everyone else's work. There's a lot of weird things happening with all the weird files for the database and things.


# Things I learned this week (not disco related)
The Faulkner County Library is so rad! They have an app that lets you borrow ebooks which was great when I needed a book for the short roadtrip Josh and I were going on. (It was is father's birthday as well moving furniture from St. Louis to Conway). Josh was able to read aloud while I drove. BUT! DRAMA! We had to seperate once we got the UHAUL and sadly I no longer had someone to read to me. BUT! Hope was not lost! because I the library app had the audio book of the book we were reading! So hope was not lost on the drive back. Anyways, use all the resources that the library has :)

# stress
I have so many assignments I need to catch up on. I am stressed. BUT! I have scheduled office hours with Dr. Yorgey so that will be helpful. I hope I can get through the semester without getting too much more stressed.
