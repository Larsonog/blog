# Disco Updates
This week we were looking to merge in a lot of our pull requests so we could get an update of our app out. The issues that I worked on for this most recent app update were:
- Fixing the call PSAFE button 
- Making the app orientation only portrait 
- letting the user know that they were exiting the app when clicking on buttons from Resource screen 
- Changed report event icon 
- Changed email subject so that it was more clear that the email was to indicate there was a problem with the event 
- Added Reserve room button on Resource screen 

I'm so glad I was able to get all of these changes done this week so that our beta testers have a newer app to look at. I am very interested to see if they like our changes or if there's something new that confuses them! I guess we'll see in this upcoming week. 

# Life updates
I went up to Fayetteville for a frisbee tournment (Harvest Moon) but unfortunetely it got rained out. Of course they didn't tell us they were canceling the tournamnent until we had already been out in the rain for an hour. I wish we could have gotten one game in! Well atleast my team will have 2 more opportunities to play this semester. Once will be against the lacrosse team in our annual charity fundraiser and the other will be to play against a club team from Little Rock. I am so glad I've kept up with frisbee, it's been a great way to make friends and to release a lot of stress. I am curious to see if I will continue to play after college. There's always a club team somewhere!
