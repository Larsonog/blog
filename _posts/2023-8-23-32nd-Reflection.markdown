## Excitement!
I am super excited to be working with Disco Tray Studios for another semester! Although I am sad that this is my last year, I think it'll be my best one yet. Suprisingly (definetely not a suprise), I feel super comfortable in my classes and as if I belong on this campus. I think that's just what happens the older you get and the longer you stay in one place. Regardless, I good about my decision to stay another year at Hendrix. Spring 2020- Fall 2020, was not the best time for me so I'm appreciative of Hendrix for giving everyone in my cohort the opportunity to make up for that time. 

## Classes I am excited about 
I also am excited to be getting a Psych minor. This semester I am taking Emotions and Social Cognition and even though I've only had one week of classes I am already know I'm going to love it. I think having a psych minor is going to be really helpful for wherever I end up after graduation. knowing how people work, as well as knowing how I work, is so cool! 

## Senior Capstone idea 
This semester I am working on my senior capstone. I think I want to essentially make an Encylopedia Conway website for new residents and college students. The goal of this website will be to consolidate all the important information that those unfamiliar with Conway might want to know. Heck, it'll be information that I will want to know too even though I have lived here my entire life! Here's the mockup of my idea below.

**Also PS I do plan on eventually changing the theme of my blog. Maybe I'll do that for my second shift I have today at the information desk.
