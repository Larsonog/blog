I just returned from Vermont for Thanksgiving break. My family wanted to drive up and see my brother before he finishes is PhD. It was lovely but the drive was 22 hours just to get there! Feels strange to not be moving any more. Since being back it feels like I'm still moving except this time its the semester that's moving around me. Well that wasn't much of a metaphor but you get the point. The semester is coming to a close and I am trying to finish everything. Also my capstone is due on December 5th. That's so soon!!! I am excited with how much project turned out but there's still so much left to do. I'll make sure to link my project once it's finished. 

As for my Disco work this past week, not much got done. I was hoping to code some in the car but it turns out coding while traveling at 70mph is difficult! This week I will be working on finishing up a feedback form on the newest updated version of the app. I am also going to look into the uploader and adding a delete event feature for the Hendrix Today people. 

All I have to do is finish the semester. I think I can do it!
