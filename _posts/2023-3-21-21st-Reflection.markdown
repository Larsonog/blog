This week was spring break and I was out of town playing frisbee all week. I really wanted to get substantive work done but I was so exhausted everyday after our games (games started at 10 and ended at 5) that I mostly just fell asleep around 8-9ish. It's crazy being out in the sun and running around all day makes you really tired! Anyways, I'm looking forward to having energy again to get more work done! Here's a picture of my team at the tournament.
