Ok! Many things happened this week!

# Community Partners
We met with the community partners that the Mobile Software Development class will be working with. I am in that class so it was really cool getting a sneak peak of who we will be working with this semester. We all split up to talk with them to help get the ball rolling. Andrei and I talked with the Homeless Coalition which was really cool. Even in that short meeting I learned a lot about how these organizations work and how they work to help homeless individuals. It was also really cool getting to hear people be passionate and prepared with a lot of information about what they want for their app.

# Disco Trays
With my project with Arkansas Asset Builders, I hit another wall. I think before I hit the wall I made a launcher and controller that would work to move between the fxml files (the pages) but alas my project decided to break again and no one knows how to fix it. Ugh!!! Dr. Goadrich and Andrei have been very nice to try and help get the project running again. It's not the code that isn't working but how everything is connected and what modules and libaries are being used. It's frustrating and I have yet to find an answer of how to fix it. I will keep looking in to it and maybe schedule another office hours meeting with Goadrich.

# Fun
This weekend the Hendrix Ultimate frisbee team went to its first tournamnet. We played 4 games back to back on Saturday and 2 Games on Sunday. Each game is either 75 minutes long or whoever gets to 13 first. Because we play as a mixed team that means we have men and women playing with and against eachother. There's a rule that you have to match the gender ratio on the field (usually either 4 men and 3 women or 5 men and 2 women). Anyways we only have 6 women on the team and one of them got hurt, so this means a I played a majority of each game. I am very tired and my legs hurt but I had a really fun time getting to play the game that we had been preparing for. Here's a cute picture of the team! I really like the ultimate frisbee enviroment. People are generally super nice and really fun to play with. I'm glad I joined the Hendrix Ultimate team.
