# Disco
### quick aside
I have learned again that I have no space on my laptop and that I really need to delete a lot of things. Ewie! I am worried about accidently deleting a file or a software that I need. Soon I will do a purge of unnecessary things on my laptop.
# meeting with Prof Yorgey
This week we met with Prof Yorgey to show her what we had accomplished and to ask more clarifying questions. We learned more about the columns and specifically what was needed, what could be ignored, and what columns were basically teh same thing but called different things. I'll link my notes from this meeting below.

## more disco
I am still working on adding a function that you could drag and drop multiple files into the database. I have been super busy this week trying to finish up everything for the end of the semester. I am #struggling.
