Prompt: Following your presentation, make a Jekyll blog post about your personal role in your team project so far, your contribution to the second client meeting, and your future plans to assist your team in completing this project.

At the beginning of this project I felt very behind. I was having a hard time understanding what our client wanted from us.
This is because I had to miss the first meeting where everything was explained.
I felt very shakey and confused by our original schema.
Since then, I've reviewed their notes and had my group explain things that I did not understand.
After the second client meeting, I was able to take my own notes and ask questions. I now feel more comfortable and confident in what we need to do.
I now feel caught up with the rest of my group and have a better idea on what we need to accomplish.
However, I do feel like I will need someone to delegate me a tasks while working on the project. Garrett and Julia seem to be the most
confident in what we need to do and how we need to do it. My goal for this project is to be present at every meeting, make sure I understand what
needs to get accomplished, and ask questions to my group and Dr. Goadrich to solve problems and confusions.

After learning how to correctly insert pictures in a blog I want to add one in just for funzies:
