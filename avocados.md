Avocados are great, we love them.

Did you know that the avocado is my favorite... uh? fruit! Yes it must be a fruit because it has a seed! Anyways I didn't like them when I was a kid but now, as a college student, I love them!
Did you know that:
- most avocados come from Mexico
- the original name for the avocado was the "alligator pear tree" (dubbed by a Irishman)
- the avocado wasn't introduced to the US until the 1950s
- they have higher potassium levels than bananas
- you can substitute it for butter in a recipe

I definitely did not know any of those facts before making this page. It's good that we both can learn some things during this process.
