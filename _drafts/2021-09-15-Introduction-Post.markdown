To be honest, this post has been very difficult to create. This is not my computer because mine wasn't working. This is being written less than 30 minutes before it is due because I've gotten so far behind. I really really really want to be able to start my labs well in advance, but when so much has piled up, it just keeps getting pushed back until the very end.
Here's some things I want to try for the future:
- break down the labs into smaller bits so that I can do at least SOME of it before class on the day its due
- use my mornings more effectively because I have no classes then. GET OUT OF BED!!!
- find a place on campus like [this](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.yRApro_6ctO-mJJ7-d6YUAHaFd&pid=Api&P=0&w=225&h=167) where I can study outside of my room, where I get too distracted
I want to get a hold of my assignments and responsibilities, and then have free time to play [some videogames I recently bought](https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/) like I've been wanting to.
